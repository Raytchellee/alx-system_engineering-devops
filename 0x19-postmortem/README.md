# Web Stack Outage Postmortem
## Overview
This README provides a detailed account of the recent web stack outage that occurred on December 9, 2023. The outage affected the authentication service, resulting in user login issues and disruptions for approximately 30% of our users.

## Incident Summary
### Duration:
December 9, 2023, 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM (GMT+1)

### Impact:
Core authentication service unavailability, impacting 30% of users.

### Root Cause:
Misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing uneven distribution of traffic.

## Timeline
### Detection:
Automated monitoring alerts triggered at 10:00 AM, indicating a spike in server response times.

### Actions Taken:
- Operations team initiated investigations into server logs and network traffic.
- Initial assumption: DDoS attack, leading to a focus on the application layer.
- 
### Misleading Paths:
Investigations initially targeted the application layer, assuming a code deployment issue.

### Escalation:
Incident escalated to the network and infrastructure team as the issue persisted.

### Resolution:
- Root cause identified as load balancer misconfiguration.
- Load balancer settings adjusted to evenly distribute traffic.

## Root Cause and Resolution
### Root Cause:
Misconfiguration in load balancer settings, leading to uneven traffic distribution.

### Resolution:
Load balancer reconfiguration to evenly distribute traffic, restoring normal functionality.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
### Improvements:

### Enhanced Monitoring:
- Comprehensive monitoring for load balancer metrics.
- Automated Alerts:
- Automated alerts for abnormal server performance patterns.
  
### Documentation Update:
Review and update load balancer configuration documentation.

## Tasks:
### Load Balancer Audit:
Conduct a thorough audit of load balancer configurations.

### Training:
Provide additional training on load balancer issue recognition and response.

### Redundancy Planning:
Develop a redundancy plan for critical services.

### Communication Protocol:
Establish a clear communication protocol for incident escalation.

## Conclusion
This postmortem outlines the incident's timeline, root cause, resolution, and steps taken for improvement. By implementing the suggested measures, we aim to fortify our infrastructure and reduce the likelihood of similar incidents in the future.
